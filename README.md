## Express Backbone Starter

An Express / Backbone Starter App for ACA fullstack

Chapter 6 seemed easy

Chapter 7 showed me that I did not understand Backbone as much as I thought I did in Chapter 6.
So I looked for a simple introduction to Backbone some online tutorials helped because they explained it in a different way. But others confused me more because it was more in-depth information than I needed to complete the Chapter 7 project. All I did was to take a one day break and approached the project as though I was coding exactly the same as the backend (changed the way I was thinking about the project). I truly want to know the most comprehensive knowledge when I am coding in any language. But now that I understand just to code without caring my projects just work fine.

Chapter 8 seems like an easy chapter.

I am learning a lot about me and my development style. I guess that might be important in the future.
